# Machine Learning American Sign Language Interpreter

This project consists of a 1GB dataset extracted from Kaggle, and has dataset has letters A - Z and extra characters within the folder. To look at the datasets, click here [here](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet#D_test.jpg).

We came up with the idea of using American sign language for predicting text. We decided to use Convolutional Neural Networks to bring us the most accurate results for our project. The dataset we used was found on Kaggle.com and consisted of 1GB of jpg photos of hands. All these photos were captured as different letters of the alphabet. Each letter held 3000 jpg photos of various different hand letters in different distances and lighting.
